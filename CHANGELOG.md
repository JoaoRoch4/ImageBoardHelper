# Changelog

## 0.7.0

- Code and documentation translated to English; `README.pt-BR.md` added
- Panel is bilingual at runtime with a language selector (automatic, Portuguese,
  English), persisted as `lang`
- Log lines stay in English by design, so bug reports are single-language
- Gesture state stores an i18n key instead of a literal string, so the label
  follows the chosen language

## 0.6.0

- Project renamed to Image Board Helper
- `localStorage` keys moved from `JMF_*` to `IBH_*`; options fall back to their
  defaults once after the update
- Console global moved from `window.__mobilefix` to `window.__ibh`
- Header gained `@homepageURL`, `@source` and `@supportURL`

## 0.5.0

- Status panel in Shadow DOM: resolved host, thumbnail mode, cover counts,
  Fancybox state and last gesture
- Log layer with levels and a 250-entry buffer; console mirror via `debug`
- Options persisted in `localStorage` (`IBH_CFG`), editable from the panel
- Diagnostics: test candidate URLs, clear host cache, copy log
- Console access through `window.__ibh`

## 0.4.1

- `forceRule34Api` now ships off: the HTML scraper sends the session cookie and
  honours the account blacklist, `filter_ai` and `post_threshold`

## 0.4.0

- Option to unlock the rule34 API path by removing `Firefox` from the
  `userAgent`, working around the `||` in `isRule34Firefox()`

## 0.3.0

- Image server resolution separated from the thumbnail host, with a list of
  thumbnail-only mirrors and a seven-day cache
- Video covers walk the candidate hosts instead of giving up on the first 404

## 0.2.0

- Single file: sharp thumbnails, video covers, Fancybox repair and gestures
- Video covers switched from a `<canvas>` frame grab to an overlaid `<video>`,
  removing the CORS dependency

## 0.1.0

- First version: gestures translated into synthetic keys and toolbar clicks
